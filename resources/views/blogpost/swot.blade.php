                    My strong point is that I can work independently but also know how
                    to collaborate in a team. I always try my best to finish my work
                    before the deadline. <br /><br />
                    My weakness is that I tend to procrastinate, which means sometimes I
                    end up finishing things at the last minute. I also need to improve
                    my planning skills. <br /><br />
                    My opportunities lie in learning more in the ICT field, especially
                    web development, as I enjoy creating websites. <br /><br />
                    A threat I face is the distance from my home to school, which
                    affects the time I spend commuting.
