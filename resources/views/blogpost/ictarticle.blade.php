                    The field of ICT is amazing, there are so many things you can do, so
                    many coding languages to learn, so many different jobs you can do,
                    it will always change so you will never be done with learning.
                    <br />
                    If you stop with coding for like a year, there is a chance that a
                    lot has changed, old functions are removed or renamed, etc... The
                    field of ICT will never sit still. <br />
                    It will always innovate and get better and better every day. Today
                    you think something is impossible and tomorrow someone made it
                    possible to do or use. <br />
