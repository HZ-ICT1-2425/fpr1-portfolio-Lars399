                    Before I went to the HZ, I did a study at Scalda in Terneuzen. This
                    was an MBO 4 study, which I completed in 3 years. <br />
                    During this study, I learned HTML, CSS, PHP, and a bit of
                    JavaScript. In my last year, we also learned Python, but that wasn't
                    a success, so we didn't continue that course. <br />
                    I also completed two internships during my study. My first
                    internship was at Ultility in Oostburg. This is a computer store
                    where they sell and repair laptops, desktops, phones, and make
                    websites using WordPress. <br />
                    My second internship was at VeiligheidsRegio Zeeland, where I had to
                    rewrite a C/P2000 receiver, set up a database, and make a P2000
                    message website. <br />
                    I used a lot of Python for the back-end during this internship. The
                    website wasn't that spectacular with the PHP code.
